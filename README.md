# Let's build a website together! 

I've had this idea for a while now where people can submit pieces of code that end up turning into an amazing website. 

## How to Contribute

Click on the Issues tab and you'll notice there will be specific issues that need to be created. Choose an issue that you'd like to work on and comment on the issue. It is very important that you comment on the issue because the first comment is the one who gets priority for creating that section.

If two people comment on the same issue, the first person who commented will get that section and the other person will have to choose a different section.

## Summary

The starter code consist of HTML, CSS and Javascript.

If you don't know how to submit a pull request, simply search it on Youtube and you'll find a lot of tutorials showing how to do it. 

Depending on how many people participate, I might feature this on my Youtube channel @Brian Design and everyone can check the repository and see who contributed to it.
